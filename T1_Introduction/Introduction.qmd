# Introduction to data science

## Data science is ...

a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data.

## Business understanding

</br>

-   Business understanding refers to defining the business problem to be solved.

-   The goal is to reframe the business problem as a data science problem.

-   Often, reframing the problem and designing a solution is an iterative process.

## Data understanding

::: incremental
-   If the goal is to solve a business problem, the data that makes up the raw material available from which the solution will be built.

-   The available data rarely matches the problem.

-   For example, historical data is often collected for purposes unrelated to the current business problem or for no explicit purpose at all.

## Numerical data

</br>

Data science methodology is based on numerical data given in tables.

> In fact, texts, images, videos or audios are transformed into this format to process them.

. . .

[***In this course, we will assume that the data is in a table.***]{style="color:#023562;"}

## Problem situation

</br>

Food pricing inequality is a crucial issue affecting access to affordable and nutritious food, particularly in **New York City**.

Previous work has suggested that the price of food sold at supermarkets may vary according to the socioeconomic characteristics of a neighborhood.

Given the importance of food prices in securing access to food, understanding how food prices vary across neighborhoods is crucial to assessing affordability.

## Goal of the problem situation

</br>

> This problem situation concerns the creation of a poster that studies the disparities in the prices of food products across the neighborhoods in New York City.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
To this end, you will have two datasets with data about food prices of a sample of supermarkets and statistics of the neighborhoods where they are located.

# The three principles of data visualization

## What is data visualization?

> “A visualization \[of data\] is any visual presentation intended to reveal evidence, making the invisible visible.” Alberto Cairo (2015).

## 

</br>

At its core, data visualization allows you to delve into complex datasets to extract meaningful insights using graphical displays.

</br>

Data visualizations are primarily concerned with providing evidence and enabling the audience to explore and draw their own conclusions about what the visualizations reveal about the data.

</br>

. . .

[***Data visualization has 3 key principles...***]{style="color:#023562;"}

::: notes
As data scientists, we create data visualizations in order to understand our data and explain our analyses to other people. A plot should have a message, and it’s our job to communicate this message as clearly as possible.
:::

## ***Principle 1*****:** Define the Message or Question

</br>

Formulate the question of interest or the message you want to convey.

El mensaje puede ser una pregunta

-   What is the key comparison?
-   How do we emphasize it?
-   Do you have reason to expect that one group/observation might be different?
-   Why might your finding about shape matter?
-   What additional comparison might add value to the investigation?
-   Are there any potentially important features to compare against?
:::

## ***Principle 2*****: *Turn Data into Information***

Your graph should use data to convey the message or answer the question. In other words, it should transform data into information.

![](images/TobaccoGraph-superJumbo.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
Enhance your graph with color symbols and text to convey additional information.

## *Principle 3: Apply Graphic Design Principles*

1.  Objects are easily identifiable by color.
2.  Use direct labels instead of a legend.
3.  Elements such as text, lines, and shapes of the same nature should look similar.
4.  Balance graphics and text.
5.  Be cautious with default settings in visualization software.
6.  Use a grid-based layout to organize your visualization.

::: notes
Don’t limit yourself to simple elements. Enhance your graph with color symbols to convey additional information. If possible, add context with markers and reference labels.

Additionally, include a legend in the graph that describes key features and summarizes its conclusions.

## Example

::: notes
The estimated costs are based on a twice-daily 10.4 mile one-way commute at peak times over the course of a week using either the UberPool option (where available) or alternatively UberX vs the cost of using a personal vehicle (including any associated costs of ownership). Study conducted in February 2017.

<https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/> is an excellent guide on data visualization.

# Activity

## Activity (cooperative mode)

1.  Get together with a partner.

2.  Find a good and a bad example of a visualization (chart) online.

3.  Save the visualizations (for example, by taking a screenshot).

4.  Write a short critique (3-4 sentences) of each visualization.

5.  Upload a document with your critiques and images to Canvas.

# Storytelling for data visualization

## Why storytelling matters in data visualization

-   Raw data alone is not enough—insights must be communicated effectively.

-   Decision-makers rely on clear, engaging, and meaningful presentations of data.

-   Good storytelling connects data to real-world problems and solutions.

. . .

For example, a simple bar chart can be enhanced by context and narrative to explain a business trend or social issue.

## The Three Components of a Data Story

1.  Data (What?)

-   The foundation—collected, cleaned, and analyzed.
-   Provides objective evidence to support claims.

2.  Visuals (How?)

-   Graphs, charts, and maps help translate numbers into meaningful insights.
-   Good design guides the audience to the key message.

## 

</br>

3.  Narrative (Why?)

-   Puts data into context—explains the significance of findings.
-   Answers: Why does this matter? Who is affected? What should be done?

## Structuring a data story

1.  Introduction (Set the Stage) 📌

-   Define the problem or question you’re addressing.
-   Provide relevant background or context.

. . .

2.  Main Findings (Show the Data) 📊

-   Use effective visuals (histograms, box plots, line charts, scatter plots, etc.).
-   Highlight key trends, comparisons, and relationships.

## 

</br>

3.  Insights & Implications (So What?) 💡

-   Explain why the findings matter.
-   Suggest potential actions or decisions based on the insights.

. . .

For example: A study on food pricing inequality might start with disparities in NYC, show visualizations comparing food prices across neighborhoods, and conclude with recommendations for policymakers.

## Best practices for storytelling

::: incremental
-   **Know Your Audience** – Tailor the message to decision-makers, engineers, or the public.

-   **Keep it Simple** – Avoid unnecessary complexity; [**clarity is key**]{style="color:darkblue;"}.

-   **Use the Right Visuals** – Choose the best chart type for your message.

-   **Emphasize Key Takeaways** – Bold the most important insights.

-   **Create a Narrative Flow** – Guide the audience through the story step by step.
